In most case, we want check the aosp source code, but we don't real need all the aosp code, just a subproject.

So this docker image setup the basic env to download aosp

you can just run `repo sync subject` to download project.

Ok, for now, we don't need you because I have already setup the aosp, maybe next time will continue.
